data process
Data processing was performed using Python (pandas, numpy), and the following processing procedures were followed:
1. Check basic data details, such as the number of rows and columns and the data type for each column.
2. Check for duplicates.
3. Deal with null values ​​appropriately for each column. An example of this is the null value in the Suppliers column. The null value was dealt with by grouping the data based on the item type and considering the most common supplier for each item type to fill in the corresponding null values.
4. Check for outliers and their impact on the analysis process.
5. Deal with text columns to ensure uniform character formatting.
6. Create a date column for chronological comparisons.
7. Creating a column for the month, quarter, and total number of cases for subsequent analysis.
